```scheme
(define (new-if predicate
                then-clause
                else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
```

```scheme
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
```

The problem with `new-if` is that it works like regular scheme
functions. That is, applicative order evaulation. So, `new-if`
will evaluate both `then-clause` and `else-clause` even if the
`guess` is good enough. This will lead to infinite recursion.
